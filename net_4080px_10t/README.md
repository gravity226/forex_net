# Net_4040px
### Summary
Third attempt at building this net. Going to use 10 ticks in every image and widen the image to 40 x 80px. Hopefully this will help?

# Workflow
### Creating Images and Vectors
 - Change the images to 40 x 80px with 10 ticks

 - Pictures are much smaller now :)
 - The json vector files are less than a 1/10 the size of the original files.  Hopefully this will solve the memory problems I am having.
